# Advent of Code in Haskell

These are my filthy scratchings in Haskell. The exercises are courtesty of http://adventofcode.com/

## "Your filthy code offends me, I'd like to improve it but I don't know how to get started with Haskell"

1. Install [Stack](https://www.stackage.org/) (it works on OS X, Linux and Windows)
2. Run `stack setup` in the root of the repository
3. Run `stack test` to see the tests run
